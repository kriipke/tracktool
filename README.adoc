# A-VCS v0.1.2

## 1. Add formal front-matter

* Include **title, version, authors, date, and status** at the very top (e.g., `:revnumber: v0.1.0`, `:revdate: 2025-08-24`, `:revremark: Draft`).
* Add a **Status of This Document** section explaining if it’s a draft, stable, or under community review.

## 2. Normalize section structure

Right now, some sections are descriptive (Overview, Workflow), some are normative (Regex, Conventions). Consider splitting into:

* *Normative* (rules that MUST be followed):

  * Vocabulary & Tokens
  * Naming Grammar
  * Folder Layout
  * Workflow
  * Regex
* *Informative* (guidance/examples):

  * Overview
  * Examples
  * Conventions & Guardrails
  * Minimal Automation
  * Git & Backups
  * Team Handoff

This makes it clearer which parts define the *standard* and which parts are *implementation guidance*.

## 3. Clarify DAW neutrality

In *Overview*, tighten wording:

* Replace Ableton-specific `als` with “*DAW project file* (e.g., `.als`, `.logicx`, `.flp`)”.
* Emphasize that the spec is **DAW-agnostic**.

## 4. Strengthen Vocabulary & Tokens

* Use a table instead of definition lists for better readability:

\[cols="1,3"]
|===
\| Token | Definition

\| TRACK | Constant, all caps, words separated by `_`. Regex: `[A-Z0-9_]+`
\| T1 | Save time token in 12h clock + `A|P` (AM/PM). Ex: `1200A`, `0942P`
\| T2 | Secondary time token (stem bounce time)
\| STEM | Uppercase identifier for track stem (e.g., `BASS`, `VOCALS`)
\| IDX | Mastering index (`1..n`) or literal `FINAL`
\| EXT | File extension (`.als`, `.wav`, `.mp3`)
|===

## 5. Make Naming Grammar explicit

* Use ABNF or EBNF grammar (common in specifications):

## \[source,abnf]

write-file   = TRACK "-" T1 "." ("als" / "wav" / "mp3")
stem-file    = TRACK "-" T1 "-" T2 "-" STEM ".wav"
unmastered   = TRACK "-" T1 "-" T2 "-\[unmastered].wav"
master       = TRACK "-" T1 "-" T2 "-" (1\*DIGIT / "FINAL") ".wav"
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is more formal than just examples.

## 6. Add file naming rationale

Explain *why*:

* Time tokens instead of semantic version numbers → matches human workflow.
* `FINAL` as immutable → ensures clarity in delivery.
* Uppercase tokens → cross-platform safety.

## 7. Improve Examples

* Show **full lifecycle of one track** in a single block:

  * Initial `.als` save
  * First bounce
  * Stems
  * Unmastered
  * Master attempts
  * Final master

This makes it crystal-clear how files evolve.

## 8. Folder Layout refinements

* Present as a **tree with mandatory/optional markers**:

```
PROJECTS/<TRACK>/
├── ableton/        (MUST)
├── stems/          (OPTIONAL if no post-processing)
├── post/           (OPTIONAL)
├── mixes/          (MUST if post)
├── masters/        (MUST if mastering)
├── manifests/      (RECOMMENDED)
└── symlinks/       (RECOMMENDED)
```

## 9. Workflow as state diagram

* Instead of a list, show a diagram (plantuml, mermaid, or ascii-art).
* Example:

```
[DAW Save] --> [Bounce] --> [Stems] --> [Unmastered] --> [Masters] --> [FINAL]
```

## 10. Regex formatting

* Wrap each regex in fenced code blocks (`source,regex`) for copy-paste clarity.
* State whether they are POSIX, PCRE, or PCRE2.

## 11. Manifests schema

* Define manifest as a **formal JSON Schema** or YAML Schema.
* Show required vs optional fields (bpm, key, notes).
* Define one consistent casing (camelCase or snake\_case).

## 12. Conventions section

* Make it explicit: use **RFC 2119 keywords** (“MUST”, “SHOULD”, “MAY”) for rules.

  * Example: “Filenames MUST contain only `[A-Z0-9_]` characters.”
* This transforms the doc from a guide into a **standard**.

## 13. Automation

* Move shell helpers into an *Appendix* to avoid breaking flow of the standard.
* Add warnings like “Implementation-specific, not normative.”

## 14. Versioning

* Include `:revnumber:` and bump this doc like semver itself (e.g., v0.1.0 → v0.2.0).
* Suggest a changelog section at the bottom:

```
== Changelog
* v0.1.0 — Initial draft
```
